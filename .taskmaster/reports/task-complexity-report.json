		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Core Orchestration and Google Sheets Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Core Orchestration and Google Sheets Integration' task into detailed subtasks, covering project initialization, secure API key management, Google Sheets API authentication and basic CRUD operations, and setting up a daily execution schedule.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational and involves several distinct technical components: project setup, secure API key handling, Google Sheets API integration (authentication, read/write operations), and setting up a scheduling mechanism. Each of these can be a significant subtask on its own, requiring careful implementation and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Content Ideation Engine (Gemini & Reddit)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Content Ideation Engine' task into subtasks, including Gemini API integration for idea generation, Reddit API integration for trending topics, parsing and formatting data from both sources, and populating the Google Sheet with new ideas and their initial status.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires integrating with two different external APIs (Gemini and Reddit), each with its own authentication and data structures. It also involves crafting effective prompts for Gemini and parsing relevant data from Reddit, then correctly formatting and writing this data to the Google Sheet."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Google Sheets Approval Workflow",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Build Google Sheets Approval Workflow' task into subtasks, focusing on implementing the polling mechanism for status changes, identifying approved items, and updating their status to 'In Progress' within the Google Sheet.",
			"reasoning": "This task primarily involves implementing a polling mechanism to detect specific status changes in the Google Sheet. While the logic is not overly complex, it requires careful handling of sheet reads, comparison of states, and targeted updates to avoid unnecessary API calls and ensure data integrity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Automated Script Generation Module",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Develop Automated Script Generation Module' task into subtasks, including defining the Gemini API prompt for short-form video scripts, integrating with the Gemini API, processing the generated script, and updating the Google Sheet with the new script.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves a single API integration (Gemini), but its core challenge lies in effective prompt engineering to consistently generate scripts of the desired length and quality. It also requires handling the API response and updating the Google Sheet accurately."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate ElevenLabs for Text-to-Speech Narration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Integrate ElevenLabs for Text-to-Speech Narration' task into subtasks, covering ElevenLabs API integration, sending script text for audio generation, handling the audio response, saving the MP3 file locally, and updating the Google Sheet with the audio file path.",
			"reasoning": "This task is a relatively straightforward API integration. It involves sending text to the ElevenLabs API, receiving an audio file, saving it to the local file system, and updating the Google Sheet with the file's path."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Pexels API for Stock Video Sourcing",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Pexels API for Stock Video Sourcing' task into subtasks, including keyword extraction from content, Pexels API integration for video search, selecting and downloading multiple video clips, and organizing them in the local directory.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating with the Pexels API, which is standard, but also requires intelligent keyword extraction from the content and handling the download and storage of multiple video files, which can add minor complexities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create FFmpeg Video Assembly Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Create FFmpeg Video Assembly Pipeline' task into detailed subtasks, focusing on designing the FFmpeg command for video stitching, synchronizing video clips with audio narration length, ensuring 9:16 aspect ratio output, and handling various input video formats.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the intricacies of FFmpeg. It requires precise command-line scripting to stitch multiple video clips, synchronize them with audio, ensure correct aspect ratio, and manage video duration. Debugging FFmpeg commands can be time-consuming."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Synchronized Caption Generation and Burning",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Develop Synchronized Caption Generation and Burning' task into subtasks, including generating synchronized SRT subtitle files from the script and audio duration, designing the FFmpeg command for burning captions onto the video, and implementing high-contrast styling for readability.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves two main complex parts: accurately generating synchronized subtitle (SRT) files based on script text and audio duration, and then using FFmpeg to burn these captions onto the video with proper styling and positioning, which often requires iterative refinement."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build YouTube Metadata Generation with Gemini",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Build YouTube Metadata Generation with Gemini' task into subtasks, including crafting effective Gemini prompts for YouTube titles, descriptions, and SEO tags, integrating with the Gemini API, and structuring the generated metadata for later use.",
			"reasoning": "This task is primarily about effective prompt engineering with the Gemini API to generate high-quality, SEO-optimized YouTube metadata. While the API integration itself is straightforward, achieving desirable output requires careful prompt design and iteration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Automated YouTube Distribution",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Automated YouTube Distribution' task into detailed subtasks, covering YouTube Data API v3 authentication (OAuth 2.0), implementing the video upload process using `videos.insert`, setting video metadata, handling upload status and errors, and updating the Google Sheet with the YouTube URL and final status.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the YouTube Data API v3's robust OAuth 2.0 authentication requirements, especially for automated, non-interactive uploads. Handling large file uploads, managing API quotas, and ensuring robust error handling for network issues or API responses add significant complexity."
