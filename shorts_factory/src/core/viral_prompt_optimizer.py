Pattern: {formula.pattern.value.upper().replace('_', ' ')}
Target Duration: {target_duration} seconds
Engagement Target: {formula.avg_engagement_rate}+/10
Primary Emotion: {emotional_trigger.upper()}

ðŸŽ¬ MANDATORY VIRAL STRUCTURE:
{chr(10).join([f"{i+1}. {step}" for i, step in enumerate(formula.structure)])}

ðŸ”¥ HOOK OPTIMIZATION (0-3 seconds):
Start with: "{hook_template}"
- Must capture attention within first 3 seconds
- Use specific numbers, ages, timeframes for credibility
- Create immediate emotional investment or curiosity gap
- Avoid generic openings - be specific and intriguing

âš¡ RETENTION OPTIMIZATION:
- {retention_tactic}
- Add mid-video hooks at 25%, 50%, 75% to prevent drop-off
- Use transition phrases: "But here's what happened next...", "The crazy part is...", "What I discovered will shock you..."
- Include callback references to hook throughout video
- End with satisfying payoff that rewards viewers for watching

ðŸ’¡ CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
Word Count: {word_count_range}
Pacing: {pacing}
Perspective: First-person narrative (more engaging/authentic)
Language: Conversational, accessible, punchy sentences
Tone: {emotional_trigger.title()} but authentic

ðŸš€ ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION:
- Include specific details that make story feel real and shareable
- Create moments worth rewatching for details
- Design natural pause points for comments/shares
- Include universal experiences that viewers will relate to
- Build to quotable/memorable moments

ðŸ’¬ ENGAGEMENT ENDING:
Conclude with: "{cta_style}"
- Ask question that sparks personal memories/experiences
- Encourage sharing story with others who would relate
- Create discussion opportunity in comments

ðŸŽ¯ VIRAL SUCCESS METRICS TO OPTIMIZE FOR:
- Hook effectiveness (3-second retention)
- Overall watch time (target 85%+ completion)
- Comment engagement (personal stories/debates)
- Share potential (relatable/shocking content)
- Rewatchability (details worth revisiting)
